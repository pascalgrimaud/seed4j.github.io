# Why Seed4J?

Seed4J is a modular code generator that helps developers bootstrap their applications with clarity, structure, and purpose. Whether you're building a proof of concept or a scalable application, Seed4J offers a clean and efficient foundation designed to grow with your project.

## üß© Modular Code Generation

Seed4J is built around the idea of generating only what you need, nothing more.

Instead of overwhelming you with a full stack of technologies or bloated code you won't use, Seed4J guides you step-by-step through creating only the features and technical layers your project requires. This modular approach gives you full control over your architecture, helps you stay focused, and keeps your codebase lightweight and maintainable.

As your application evolves, you can add new modules when you need them, not before. No unused code, no technical debt from the start.

## üõ°Ô∏è Clean & Hexagonal Architecture

Seed4J is not just about generating code, it‚Äôs about generating the right code, based on clean architecture principles.

The entire platform is built on **hexagonal architecture**, encouraging a clear separation between domain logic and infrastructure. This makes your application easier to test, adapt, and evolve over time.

By default, Seed4J promotes clean code practices, organizing your project into well-defined layers. Business logic is kept at the center, while technical concerns like persistence or web APIs are placed at the edges. This architecture is a solid foundation for long-term scalability and quality.

## üéØ Designed for Developer Experience

From setup to daily development, Seed4J is designed with **developer experience** in mind.

The project includes out-of-the-box tooling, fast startup time, and carefully crafted conventions to make development smoother. No more boilerplate or confusing configuration, you get a ready-to-run app in seconds.

Beyond tooling, Seed4J promotes **craftsmanship**: it encourages writing readable, maintainable, and well-tested code. With features like 100% test coverage, zero duplication, and clean separation of concerns, it‚Äôs the kind of foundation developers are proud to build on.
