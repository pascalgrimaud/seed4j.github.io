  Generate basic files like `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and license, ideal to start cleanly.

- ðŸ¥‹ [Java kata project](./java-kata.md):  
  Bootstrap a simple Java app with tests, perfect for TDD sessions or coding katas.

- ðŸ¥‹ [TypeScript kata project](./ts-kata.md):  
  Quickly set up a TypeScript-based kata environment with linting and tests.

- ðŸš€ [Real Java backend project](./java-backend.md):
